<h3>What is CTF??</h3>
<pre>
Capture The Flag(CTF) is a special kind of Security Competitions. There are Three common type of CTFs:
 1) Jeopardy
 2) Attack and Defence CTF
 3) Mixed CTF
In CTF Basically Flag is Special kind of "STrinG" which have to find for points.

<h3>1.Binary Explotation</h3>

   Binary exploitation is the process of subverting a compiled application such that it violates some trust boundary in a way<br> that is advantageous to you, the attacker. In this module we are going to focus on memory corruption. By abusing<br> vulnerabilities that corrupt memory in software we can often rewrite critical application state information in a way that<br>allows us to elevate privileges inside the context of a particular application (like a remote desktop server) or perform arbitrary computation by hijacking control flow and running code of our choosing.<br>

<h3>2.Reversing</h3>

Reverse Engineering in a CTF is typically the process of taking a compiled (machine code, bytecode) program and converting it back into a more human readable format.<br>

 Very often the goal of a reverse engineering challenge is to understand the functionality of a given program such that you can identify deeper issues.

 <h3>3.Web</h3>
 
 
 In Web Challenge Basically We have to Exploit Vulnerability in Protocol or Langauge, like **PHP** and **xml** OR We have to<br>take Control Over **HTTP** Requests which is to Server or From Server, But It is very Brief About CTF Web Challenges.

3. [Payloads](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/)


<h3>4.Forensic</h4>

  Forensics is a broad CTF category that does not map well to any particular job role in the security industry, although some challenges model the kinds of tasks seen in Incident Response (IR). Even in IR work, computer forensics is usually<br> the domain of law enforcement seeking evidentiary data and attribution, rather than the commercial incident<br> responder who may just be interested in expelling an attacker and/or restoring system integrity.,br>

3. [Hidden](https://ctfs.github.io/resources/topics/steganography/invisible-text/README.html)



<h3>5.Miscellaneous</h3>

 Many challenges in CTFs will be completely random and unprecedented, requiring simply logic, knowledge, and patience to be solved. There is no sure-fire way to prepare for these, but as you complete more CTFs you will be able to recognize and hopefully have more clues on how to solve them.<br>

<h3>6.OS/LinUx</h3>

  Basically This Challenges about of, Basic upto Advanced Level of **Enumeration** of Operating System Mainly Linux and its Shell.
 
 
<h3>7.Cryptography</h3>

  In the case of CTFs, the goal is usually to crack or clone cryptographic objects or algorithms to reach the flag.

<h3>8.RecOn/Scripting</h3>

  In this Challenges basically flag is hidden in Social Media Platform, and In Scripting Challenges You have to write script<br> which Automatically does Tasks.
